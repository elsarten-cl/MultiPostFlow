/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-generated
 * content, including drafts, post states, and automation logs, is stored in subcollections
 * under that user's specific document. This ensures that users can only access and manage
 * their own data, providing strong data privacy and isolation by default.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized hierarchically, starting with a top-level '/users'
 * collection. Each user document, identified by their UID, serves as the root for their
 * private data trees, which include '/drafts', '/postStates', and '/automationLogs' subcollections.
 * This structure is fundamental to the security model, as ownership is determined by the document path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration Disabled: Listing documents in the top-level '/users' collection is explicitly
 *   disallowed to protect user privacy and prevent scraping of user information.
 * - Path-Based Security: Access to all subcollection documents is primarily controlled by matching
 *   the authenticated user's ID with the '{userId}' wildcard in the path. This is a highly
 *   performant and secure method.
 * - Default Deny: Any operation not explicitly granted is denied. There are no public write
 *   permissions.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The '/drafts' documents contain a denormalized 'userId' field.
 * This is used during document creation and updates to enforce relational integrity, ensuring that a
 * draft created under a user's path also contains their ID internally. This prevents data misattribution.
 * For other subcollections like 'postStates' and 'automationLogs', authorization relies solely on the
 * document path, which is secure and sufficient for this ownership model.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: The design inherently separates each user's private data from others by
 * nesting it within their own document tree (e.g., /users/{userId}/drafts/{draftId}). This pattern
 * simplifies security rules and makes it impossible for users to query or list data belonging to others.
